# STUFF
Markdowners is an awesome Markdown parser for a school project

It takes a simple Markdown file and turn it to html tags, so I can write less HTML for my school project.

# USAGE:
    markdowners --html-path <HTML_PATH> --md-path <MD_PATH>

	it can also be used as a library i think u do the uhh markdown_2_Html thing u look up in docs idc

# OPTIONS:
    -h, --html-path <HTML_PATH>    
        --help                     Print help information
