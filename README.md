# Stuff
Markdowners is an awesome attempt at a Markdown parser for a school project

It aims to take a simple Markdown file and parse it into HTML, so I don't have to write HTML for my school project.

# Usage
this doesn't work, but it will be like: 
	markdowners md-file-path html-file-path

# Things I'm trying to support
[ ] bold text
[ ] italic text
[ ] italic  and also bold text
[ ] links
[ ] images
